# Customer Insights
The better you can understand your customers, the better you can build customer relationships. For a greater understanding, you need access to contextual information about customers at the right moment. The Customer Insights extension for Zoho Desk provides real-time insights about customers right next to their ticket. You can view insights for each customer like the number of tickets received, response and resolution times, and their happiness rating percentage. These insights enable you to stay ahead of customer issues by tailoring your responses to their needs and offering proactive services.

##Key Features
* View the total number of open, on hold, and closed tickets for the contact.
* View the overall happiness rating score and the percentage of good, neutral, and bad ratings.
* See average response, average first response, and average resolution time for the contact.
